## Mah Linux

I built a home computer using GA-Z77-HD3 motherboard, i3 CPU and five WD disks. It's supposed to be a file server but I also use it as normal desktop. Here are some notes primarily for myself about the configuration in case I have to redo it.

### BIOS

Motherboard comes with F1 version, GA website says F2b is available but it's beta. I was able to find F3. Here are these versions for the reference. F3 seems to be working just fine so I'm sticking with it. The update is simple: format USB stick with FAT, copy files there, start PC and hit End key or select QFlash from BIOS settings. There you can select BIOS images from USB stick and update the PC.
